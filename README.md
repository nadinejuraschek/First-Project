### Motivation
Mental Health awareness is becoming more and more prevalent in today's culture as society is learning to focus more on it. Everyone experiences stress, anxiety, or even depression at least once in a while. Keeping track of negative as well as positive emotions can help find triggers and therefore prevent certain mental health problems.
